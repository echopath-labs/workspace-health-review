# Workspace Health Review Reference

Use this reference to perform a workspace-level governance health review.

The goal is not to collect every document. The goal is to identify whether a human or agent can safely understand, change, and resume work in the workspace.

## Review Areas

### 1. Workspace Boundary

Check whether the repository or workspace boundary is clear.

Look for:

- `.git/`, worktree boundaries, or nested repositories;
- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, or similar agent entries;
- package, service, app, library, plugin, build, CI, or deployment boundaries;
- child workspaces that should own their own instructions or durable records.

Flag risks when:

- the root workspace appears to own details that belong to a child workspace;
- child workspaces have independent build/release behavior but no local agent entry;
- instructions tell agents to read broad parent context before finding the smallest owner.

### 2. Durable Record Health

Review the durable record systems already present. These may include OpenSpec, ADRs, issues, design docs, runbooks, project notes, release notes, or decision records.

Flag risks when:

- important decisions are only in chat history;
- active records have no owner, next step, or status;
- completed records remain active without reason;
- records duplicate each other without references;
- records cannot be used as recovery entry points;
- stale records contradict current code or instructions.

Do not introduce a new durable record system without user approval.

### 3. Agent Instruction Health

Review agent-facing instructions.

Common files include:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `.cursor/rules`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `.codex/skills`
- project-specific prompts or playbooks

Flag risks when:

- instructions are too long for routine startup;
- the same rules appear in several files and can drift;
- rules mix general workflow, release safety, project facts, and task-specific history;
- instructions tell agents to mutate durable memory without human approval;
- private or environment-specific operations are described without safety gates.

### 4. Skill And Rule Load

Estimate whether the workspace loads too many rules or skills by default.

Flag risks when:

- many skills are globally active when only a few are relevant;
- project-specific skills are installed globally;
- large references are loaded for casual or read-only tasks;
- rules are not scoped by task type, workspace, or risk level;
- obsolete skills remain available and compete with newer rules.

### 5. Ownership And Recovery Health

Review whether future humans or agents can resume work.

Healthy workspaces usually answer:

- Which workspace owns this behavior?
- Where is the authoritative durable record?
- What is the first file to read?
- Which keywords recover the context?
- What is the next step?
- Which records are active, archived, deprecated, or disposable?

Flag risks when:

- ownership is unclear;
- recovery requires reading many unrelated documents;
- active work has no next step;
- important records have no stable entry point;
- archived or deprecated context still appears as active.

### 6. Context Drift And Context Debt

Context drift means instructions, docs, records, and code no longer agree.

Context debt means accumulated context makes future work slower, riskier, or more expensive.

Examples:

- old decisions still appear authoritative;
- root docs duplicate child docs;
- multiple rules describe different branch or release behavior;
- stale active changes remain after completion;
- onboarding requires reading too many files before doing safe work.

## Scoring Guidance

Use scores as communication tools, not as fake precision.

Suggested scale:

- `85-100`: Healthy. Minor cleanup only.
- `65-84`: Watch. Some debt or unclear ownership exists.
- `40-64`: Risky. Recovery or safe agent work is likely degraded.
- `0-39`: Critical. Governance is unclear enough to block safe scaling.

Always explain the score with concrete evidence.

## Recommendation Levels

- `P0`: Must address before high-risk work, release, or large refactor.
- `P1`: Should address soon to reduce recovery cost or agent error.
- `P2`: Useful cleanup or documentation improvement.

Separate observations from proposed modifications. If a recommendation changes files, label it as requiring approval.
