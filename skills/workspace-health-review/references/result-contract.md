# Workspace Health Review Result Contract

Read this reference only when a user requests machine-readable review state or
an approved integration exchanges structured input or output.

The human-readable report remains the default. This contract is an optional
adapter and must not change the review areas, evidence standard, or approval
boundary.

## Optional Input Envelope

```yaml
schema_version: 1
input_type: workspace_health_review_input
mode: standalone | platform-integrated
workspace:
  root: path
  declared_children: [path]
review_scope: [path]
review_trigger: requested | periodic | pre-refactor | pre-release | onboarding | cleanup | other
declared_sources:
  - ref: path-or-id
    kind: agent-entry | durable-record | skill | rule | recovery-index | health-snapshot | other
    origin: user | repository | platform
    observed_at: timestamp | null
project_extensions:
  - name: string
    source: path-or-id
prior_review: path-or-id | null
```

Platform and project-extension values are review inputs, not a health verdict.
Verify machine-checkable claims against current workspace evidence when
practical. Omit unavailable optional fields or use `null`; never invent values.

## Output Rules

- Findings must lead with observable evidence, not a score.
- Numeric scoring remains optional and requires an explicit method.
- Mark project-specific checks as `project-extension`; do not present them as
  universal rules.
- Keep repository observations separate from platform-provided evidence.
- Do not include secrets, raw private platform state, hidden scoring formulas, or
  chain-of-thought.
- A returned report is not permission to archive, delete, rewrite, or mutate
  durable context.
- If task-level implementation is needed, hand it off as a separate approved
  workflow rather than modifying files during the review.
